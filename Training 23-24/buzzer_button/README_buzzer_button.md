PURPOSE OF CIRCUIT:

<p>This curcuit makes the buzzer ring while the button is being pressed.</p>
  
HARDWARE USED:
- Arduino UNO R3.
- <p>Breadboard, 2 Resistors (220Î©), 5 Cables, 1 Buzzer, 1 Button.</p>
HARDWARE CONNECTIONS:

- The button is reffered to as "buttonPin" and it is matched with the value 13. Similarly, the buzzer is reffered to as "buzzerPin" and it is matched with the value 12.

- The buzzer's positive leg is plugged in Digital Pin (PWD) number 12 through a resistor and its negative leg is plugged in a GND pin.

- The button's bottom left leg is plugged in 5V through a resistor and the bottom right leg is plugged in a GND pin. The upper left leg is plugged in a Digital Pin (PWD) number 13.
