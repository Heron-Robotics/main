PURPOSE OF CIRCUIT:
<paragraph expailing the idea of circuit making>
<e.g. This circuit makes a LED shine for 1 second, then turns it off for another 1 sec, and repeats>
HARDWARE USED:
- Arduino UNO R3
- <other equipment (e.g. breadboard, wires, 2 buttons, 3 resistors of 330ΩΩ, etc>
HARDWARE CONNECTIONS:
References to :
- Globals/ Constants on code (name that matches with part/port/pin of equipment)
<e.g. The red LED is reffered to as "LED", type of integer (constant), with global scope. This constant is matched with the value of "12">
- Basic connections between a part/port/pin of equipment and the other end they matched
<e.g. The LED's short leg is plugged in Digital Pin (PWD) number 12, and its long leg goes to a GND pin straight to the Arduino board>
